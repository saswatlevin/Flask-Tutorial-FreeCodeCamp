To activate Virtual Environment: source env/bin/activate

Package Requirements:
1. Flask
2. Flask-SqlAlchemy

pip3 install flask
pip3 install flask-sqlalchemy

1. Template Inheritance: Write the skeleton of a template (in my case, index.html)
and then use it in subsequent templates.

2. {% block head %} {% endblock %}. This is Jinja2 Template Syntax to be able to substitute
code in the block shown here. The substitution takes place in the child template.

3. The Jinja2 syntax used in 2 is used for things like for-loops, if-else stmts,etc.

4. "{{}}" is used to get the results of strings.

5. url_for('main_folder_name', filename = 'path_to_file') used to get file paths.

6. 'sqlite:///path_here' with 3 fwd slashes is a relative path. 'sqlite:////path_here' with 4 fwd slashes
is an absolute path.

7. db.create_all() is used to create the sqlite database on flask. It is done only once.
